FAQ
========

New versions of KBEngine contain new features, more reliable code, bug fixes, and contributions from the community. Since version `0.2.0` KBEngine has an inbuilt command to download and install everything for you automatically. Don't worry, **it will ask for confirmation** before overwriting your files.

    python $KBE_ROOT/kbe/tools/server/install/installer.py update

Check Your Version
------------------

    python $KBE_ROOT/kbe/tools/server/install/installer.py version

The version command will return the current KBEngine version you have installed, useful for checking the upgrade was successful.
